Collab Commit
=============

It's `prosemirror-collab` but more performant!

Classes and utilities used to process commit-based collab updates on the *authority*.

> **Authority:** the system responsible for maintaining a linear prosemirror history. Likely a DotNet-based
backend in this case, however it could be any node running this code..
